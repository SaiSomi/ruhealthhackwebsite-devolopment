                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <p><b class="redtext">What Is A Hackathon?</b><br><br>
                A healthcare hackathon is an event where multidisciplinary teams including 
                healthcare professionals, engineers, designers, developers, and business experts 
                come together to collaborate on solving healthcare-related problems using 
                technology and innovation. It is organized as a competitive event where teams 
                work on a variety of problems over 3 days and eventually pitch their proposal to a 
                panel of judges.
                </p>
                <p><b class="redtext">What is the purpose of this event?</b><br><br>
                    The hackathon environment encourages collaboration, rapid prototyping, and 
                    innovative thinking. Participants are encouraged to think outside the box, find 
                    creative ways to address healthcare challenges, leverage emerging technologies, 
                    and improve the overall quality of healthcare. Participants and mentors get an 
                    opportunity to network with each other, and winning teams could be able to 
                    seek additional seed funding. 
                </p>
                <p><b class="redtext">Who Can Participate?</b><br><br>

                    and different career stages (undergraduate/graduate/early and late career) from all 
                    over the country. Interested participants will apply through an online form and 
                    coordinators will select participants to emphasize diversity in backgrounds/career 
                    stages. All participants will need to be on site and in person.
